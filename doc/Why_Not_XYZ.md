# Why not XYZ but anothr project generator ?
I think this is the most common question people asked me.

The answer is simple, it's because no other generator fit what I want.
Of cause every generator has their own pros and crons, but one size doesn't fit all.

After years of looking for my favourite generator, I still couldn't find single one I happy with, so at the end I decided to make one, it may not be perfect, but at least it fit what I really need.

And I'm not trying let it replace others, so if you happy with what you are using, then just keep doing, but if not, you can try to take a look of this one.
